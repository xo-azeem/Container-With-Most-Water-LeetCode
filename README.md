# Container With Most Water

LeetCode Q # 11.

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:

<div align = "center">

</div>

>Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]</br>
>Output: 49</br>
>Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.</br>

Example 2:

>Input: height = [1,1]</br>
>Output: 1
